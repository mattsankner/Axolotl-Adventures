# **Welcome to the Axolotl series!**

Here, I'll be documenting what I learn as I become more and more adept at fine-tuning LLM's with the Axolotl library. Axolotl is a library that aids in fine-tuning LLM's on your dataset by making changes to a yaml file. It's built on the HuggingFace Transformers library. 

These blogs detail projects I'm doing as I'm taking the [Mastering LLM's](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/fine-tuning) course. I'll share my code and anecdotes throughout. My goal is to provide context for what we're doing as we're doing it for beginners like me, as well as advanced insights as I iterate through these projects.
